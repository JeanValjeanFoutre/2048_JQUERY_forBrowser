# 2048_JQUERY

Hi guys, here is a mini project I made during my formation at EPITECH. 

To execute the game, just open index.js in your browser and select the size of the game grid (from 4x4 to 7x7 tiles), and confirm, then, start playing !

Rules of 2948 can be red here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)

enjoy
